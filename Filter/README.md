# Chemical structure filter for removing useless chemical structures (unstable, not synthesizable, toxic) from chemical structures generated by AI model

*Chiaki Nakamori* & *Tore Eriksson*

This filter is the rule-based expert system. Rules are written in filter.csv file. Currently, many useless structures pass through the filter. To improve this system, more SMARTS rules need to be added in filter.csv file.
